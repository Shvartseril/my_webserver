    <p class="game_p">The very first computer game was released in 1952 and became the prototype
        of the tic-tac-toe board game. Tic-Tac-Toe was a 3x3 square field, the player made a move,
        in response, the computer also made a move. It was created by A.S. Douglas and was located
        on a large computer. The game played a key role in the story, but still did not fully meet
        the definition of a video game.</p>

        and to the amazement of the creator, it was a huge success. The development of Tennis

    <h2 id="third_game_h2">game "SPACE WAR"</h2>

        gain momentum. In 1962, the first computer game was developed by programmers of the Institute
        in Massachusetts. The first SpaceWar can be called due to the fact that it was the only game
        at that time developed directly for the computer. Writing this program took place on a PDP-1
        machine and took a total of about 200 hours. It was for this game that the game controller
        was created.</p>
